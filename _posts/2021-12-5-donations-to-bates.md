This is a class project I did and the code is available [here](https://github.com/khagolim/Archives-Data-Analysis-Project).

## Data Set
![Dataframe](/assets/batesdonations/Data_set.jpeg)
This data was collected manually from Bates' Archives. This data includes the donors for Bates in the 19th and 20th centuries. Then we manually augmented the data for information such as the gender and the jobs of each donor. We had to first decode the cursive writing as it was written a long time ago. Then we had to adjust the donations according to inflation along with some data cleaning. A small subsection of the data is shown above.

## Overall Donations Trends

The first plot shows a negative correlation between overall giving throughout the two centuries.

The second plot uses Data visualization(which was a major theme discussed in our programming class) to show the number of donors and their donations.

## 19th Century vs 20th century Donations

In the first graph we can see a clear increase in the number of female donors in the 20th century as compared to the 19th century.

In the second graph we can see that there is an increase in the inflation adjusted amount donated in the 20th century as compared to the 19th century.

This correlation between increased number of female donors and increase in the inflation adjusted amount led us to having some interesting hypothesis.
